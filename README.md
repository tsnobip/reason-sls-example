# Reason SLS example

This repo is meant to be used as a starter template for an AWS node Lambda Serverless project with Bucklescript. Yes it's a mouthful! :)

Thanks to webpack, the bundle is extremely small (5 kB vs 50 MB without).

## Install

Clone the repo and just run `yarn` or `npm install` to set it up.

## Deploy

```
sls deploy
```
